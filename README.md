#  Computational Intelligence course

This is a repository for the Computational Intelligence course at AGH University of Science and Technology. 

This project is based on LEAP Python library and irace, created in R language, to create a metaoptimization framework for continuous problems. As the main example in this repository I have used the Shekel problem. The results where calculated at ACK Cyfronet AGH HPC center.

To see the full project documentation, please go to [documentation](documentation) folder. Documentation is written in Polish.
